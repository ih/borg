Setting up a connection between mindwave and raspberry pi using  http://docs.python.org/2/library/socketserver.html

Seems like sdl_viewer.py is not picking up the mindwave signal.  trying to find if the usb port is, but if that doesn't work can try different python library https://github.com/BarkleyUS/mindwave-python

lsusb can be used to list usb devices ir looka likw mindwave is Bus 001 Device 005

No real luck getting the mindwave to connect directly to the raspberry pi using mindwave-python or python-mindwave.  Put up a question on Stackoverflow, but doubtful of responses.  The next approach will be to set up a simple communication link between the computer the mindwave works with and the raspberry pi using socketserver (http://docs.python.org/2/library/socketserver.html)

Setting up VNC on the PI so it's easier to get going
